#### Just coming back from a studying break due to work commitments and have completed my Post Graduate Diploma in Acoustics and Vibrations with the Institute of Acoustics. Currently working on a mix of Gyoshin (stretch features and debugging, with code now available on Martijins github and I am currently getting use to making pull requests, committing and merging), Continuing Codecademy's computer science course (with work on adventure.py to continue soon, and planning a discord bot for Codecademy London Chapter. 

## Current Projects:
- Leading node.js discord bot with the codecademy london chapter. completed main file and my functions, soon will be assisting with new programmers to complete their .js files.

- Gyoshin the raid planner discord bot. Written in python, a discord bot build in colabboration with Martijin Bos, includes SQLite. Although this project is 99% complete, with minor adjustments, there will be potential major overhauls with the recent Discord.py news.

- Adventure.Py (Classic text based adventure). - scrapped as I intend to put my learning of each codecademy module into a larger project, including databases and memory management with C++ rather than Python, and will focus python to the data orientated projects. 

## Upcoming Projects:

- Completion of 2/3 Data analysis/Data Science projects once current projects and CodeCademy bot is completed.
- Unreal Engine Game.
