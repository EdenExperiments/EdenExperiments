#### Just coming back from a studying break due to work commitments and have completed my Post Graduate Diploma in Acoustics and Vibrations with the Institute of Acoustics. Currently working on a mix of Gyoshin (stretch features and debugging, with code now available on Martijins github and I am currently getting use to making pull requests, committing and merging), Continuing Codecademy's computer science course (with work on adventure.py to continue soon, and planning a discord bot for Codecademy London Chapter. 

## Current Projects:
- Gyoshin the Raid Planner Bot (Alongside Martijin Bos).
- Adventure.Py (Classic text based adventure).

## Upcoming Projects:
- Discord Bot in collaboration of CodeCademy London Chapter.
- Completion of 2/3 Data analysis/Data Science projects once current projects and CodeCademy bot is completed.
